There are no hard and fast rules for making a start on a template. I like to duplicate **BlankTemplate** and start from there because it already provides the basic structure of the file.

This leaves me with the following template (`Template_Goblin_Ogre.json`): (**note: the file could be looking different in the current version of the game**)

```json
{
  "Type": "Abstract",
  "Parameters": {
    "Appearance": {
      "Value": "Bear_Grizzly",
      "Description": "Model to be used"
    },
    "DropList": {
      "Value": "Empty",
      "Description": "Drop Items"
    },
    "MaxHealth": {
      "Value": 100,
      "Description": "Max health for the NPC"
    },
    "NameTranslationKey": {
      "Value": "server.npcRoles.Template.name",
      "Description": "Translation key for NPC name display"
    }
  },
  "Appearance": { "Compute": "Appearance" },
  "DropList": { "Compute": "DropList" },
  "MaxHealth": { "Compute": "MaxHealth" },
  "MotionControllerList": [
    {
      "Type": "Walk",
      "MaxWalkSpeed": 3,
      "Gravity": 10,
      "MaxFallSpeed": 8,
      "Acceleration": 10
    }
  ],
  "Instructions": [
    {
      "Sensor": {
        "Type": "Any"
      },
      "BodyMotion": {
        "Type": "Nothing"
      }
    }
  ],
  "NameTranslationKey": { "Compute": "NameTranslationKey" }
}
```

And the following variant (`Goblin_Ogre.json`) next to the template. There's a translation key in the template used for localisation of the NPC name, but we won't worry about that for now since it's not required for the NPC to work.

```json
{
  "Type": "Variant",
  "Reference": "Template_Goblin_Ogre",
  "Modify": {
    "Appearance": "Goblin",
    "MaxHealth": 124
  }
}
```

Our artists have not yet finished animations for the `Goblin_Ogre`, for that sake of the tutorial I am going to use appearance `Goblin`, because it offers a more complete set of animations that we will need.
