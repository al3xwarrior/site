title: How to edit and create Biomes
description: Explores where world generation assets can be found and how to edit them.
---

### Where are the Assets

World generation assets are kept in the HytaleGenerator directory within the assets.

```
/Server/HytaleGenerator/
```

<div className="flex flex-row rounded-lg border p-4">
  <div className="flex-1/2 border-r pr-4">
    ```
    /Biomes
    ```

    Biome assets, with content configurations.
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1/2 pl-4">
    ```
    /WorldStructure
    ```

    Generator files that define which biomes spawn together.
  </div>
</div>

<div className="flex flex-row rounded-lg border p-4">
  <div className="flex-1/2 border-r pr-4">
    ```
    /Density
    ```

    Density assets that can be referenced by any other assets.
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1/2 pl-4">
    ```
    /Assignments
    ```

    Prop assets that can be referenced by any Biome assets.
  </div>
</div>

An example of this structure can be found bellow, packed in an asset pack with the instance configuration.

Ensure you place your asset pack in the correct directory, under Mods.

### How to visit our worlds

The generation assets define a set of generators but on their own you cannot visit these. Currently you require an Instance with a generator that will allow you to visit your work.

```
/Server/Instances/
```

Instances are separate worlds that players can join using the `/instances` command. Each instance has an `Instance.bson` configuration asset that specifies which generator to use, among other worldly settings.

```json
{
  "WorldGen": {
    "Type": "HytaleGenerator",
    "WorldStructure": "Basic",
    "playerSpawn" : {
      "X" : 123,
      "Y" : 480,
      "Z" : 10000,
      "Pitch" : 0,
      "Yaw" : 0,
      "Roll" : 0
    }
  }
}
```

You can create custom instances for different world structures and biomes as you need them.

### How to edit Biomes

We currently use the Hytale Node Editor when editing world generation assets. This can be accessed while in-game from the Content Creation menu when pressing B. The node editor is then found under the asset editor dropdown on the upper left.&#x20;

Once you have the Hytale Node Editor open, through the file menu you can open Biomes by navigating to the Biomes directory and selecting one from your pack.&#x20;

```
/Server/HytaleGenerator/Biomes/
```

### Biome Asset Structure

Every Biome has a root Biome node, this node splits into 5 structures. This is covered briefly but more information on each field can be found on the World Generation Concepts page.

<Callout>
Each biome is for the most part self contained, meaning it has control over what appears with the biome. The only exception to this are Base Heights.
</Callout>

<Tabs>
<Tab value="Terrain">
Mathematical function nodes that calculate the physical shape of the Biome's terrain.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Materials">
Logical nodes that determine what materials (blocks) make up a Biome's terrain.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Props">
Function nodes that add objects like prefabs and decorations to the terrain.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Environments">
Logical nodes that determine the environment asset at a given coordinate within the biome. This asset determines things like weather, NPC spawns, and sounds.
</Tab>

<Tab value="Tints">
Logical function nodes that determine a colour code that can be used by certain blocks in the world. Typically this will be grasses and soils.

### How to preview your work

Once you are in an Instance world with the Hytale Generator active you will only be able to see your work by generating new chunks. There are a few ways to do this.

The viewport command selects an area around the Player that will live reload as you make changes to the generator.&#x20;

```
/viewport --radius 5 
```

You can also create a new world to show your changes.&#x20;

```
/instances spawn <instance> 
```

The last option is to simply fly south, new chunks will generate with the changes made.
