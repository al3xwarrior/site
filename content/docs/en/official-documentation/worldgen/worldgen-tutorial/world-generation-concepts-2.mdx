### Props

Props enable you to generate content in a specific limited region. Hytale has a range of different Prop types that you can use to build content that gets procedurally added to the world. You can define where the content places by using a combination of Positions fields, Scanners and Patterns.

<div className="flex flex-row rounded-lg border p-4">
  <div className="flex-1/3 border-r pr-4">
    **Positions**

    Provides the locations to scan in.
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1/3 border-r pr-4">
    **Scanner**

    An area or column around each position to scan, finds the locations that match the Pattern.
  </div>
  <div className="flex-1/3 pl-4">
    **Pattern**

    The Pattern that defines what are valid positions based on the contents of the world.
  </div>
</div>
