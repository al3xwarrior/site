So, you want to make your blocks feel more alive through animations, do you?  
Now for the most part this is the exact same as [Creating custom blocks](./creating-block).
![blue fire gif](/assets/guides/blue_fire.gif)


## Prerequisites
This is NOT a guide on animating or texturing or even using BlockBench, why? Because I don't know how to do that.  
The only thing we will be doing is taking the fire texture, changing the color, and applying it to our new fire block.

## Setup
To start, you're obviously going to want to grab the `Common/VFX/Fire/Fire.png` file. How you do it is up to you, in the Asset Editor you'll need to switch to the Common tab.  
I'll assume you know how colorize or change the hue of an image, so go ahead and do that now and save it as `Blue_Fire.png`.  
 
The other assets used in this guide are `Common/VFX/Fire/Fire.blockymodel` and `Common/Blocks/Animations/Fire/Fire_Burn.blockyanim` (both renamed to `Blue_Fire`) but since we won't be changing them it's probably fine to leave them. I will reference the `Blue_Fire` versions as a way to point out what should be custom assets.  
I will also duplicate `Server/Item/Item/Deco/Deco_Fire.json` and call it `Deco_Blue_Fire.json`.  
 
## Applying the changes
The `Deco_Blue_Fire` block is actually just a particle emitter, however we will not be using particles, so lets start by removing them in `Block > Particles`.  
Next we want to set the Block Model (called `CustomModel` in JSON) to `VFX/Blue_Fire/Blue_Fire.blockymodel` and Block Model Textures (`CustomModelTexture` in JSON) to 
```json
[
    {
        "Texture": "VFX/Blue_Fire/Blue_Fire.png",
        "Weight": 1
    }
]
```
Finally, we will apply the .blockyanim to our model, this is done through the Block Model Animation property (`CustomModelAnimation` in JSON) and the value should be `Blocks/Animations/Blue_Fire/Blue_Fire_Burn.blockyanim`.  
  
## Final Code
With that your new blue fire should be done. Here is the minimal JSON for our blue fire.  
There is an additional `Looping` and `RequiresAlphaBlending` property that I have not gone over, however I hope it is self-explanatory.
```json
{
  "BlockType": {
    "DrawType": "Model",
    "CustomModel": "VFX/Blue_Fire/Blue_Fire.blockymodel",
    "CustomModelAnimation": "Blocks/Animations/Blue_Fire/Blue_Fire_Burn.blockyanim",
    "CustomModelTexture": [
      {
        "Texture": "VFX/Blue_Fire/Blue_Fire.png",
        "Weight": 1
      }
    ],
    "Looping": true,
    "RequiresAlphaBlending": false
  },
  "PlayerAnimationsId": "Block"
}
```

                <File name="Blue_Fire.blockymodel" />

## Next steps
Now that you know how to attach an animation to a block, try adding it to a block state.
